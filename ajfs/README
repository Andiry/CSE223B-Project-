AJFS Source Directory README
by Joe DeBlasio and Andiry Xu, SP2013

=============== CRITICAL SETUP ===============
    SYSTEMS MUST BE ABLE TO SSH TO EACH OTHER WITHOUT A PASSWORD. If they can't,
    the join procedure will fail.

    The easiest way to set this up, assuming nodes share home directories (for
    instance via NFS), is roughly:
        $ mkdir -f ~/.ssh
        $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -p -N "" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
        $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

    Then, you must ssh once to every machine that you want to use in the
    cluster. (This is just to store every hosts info in ~/.ssh/known_hosts).

    Also, please make sure that FUSE and Thrift are installed properly and can
    be found by 'pkg-config'.

=============== COMPILING ===============
To compile, run:
    $ make

    (if you make any changes to a header file, make sure to remake with
    "make -B"-- there's a bug in the Makefile wherein the header files aren't
    seen as dependencies for cpp files that include them).

=============== RUNNING ===============
Once compiled, you can AJFS by running:
    $ ./ajfs MNT_PT BACKUP_DIR LOCAL_HOSTNAME LOCAL_PORT [RM_HOSTNAME RM_PORT]

    Where:
        MNT_PT          - the directory you want to mount AJFS to.
        BACKUP_DIR      - the backup database directory that AJFS serves from.
        LOCAL_HOSTNAME  - the hostname that this system can be referred to as
        LOCAL_PORT      - the port to listen on
    and optionally:
        RM_HOSTNAME     - the hostname of a node in a pre-existing AJFS cluster.
        RM_PORT         - the port of the node in a pre-existing AJFS cluster.

I recommend running the system as follows:
    On the first node (say hostname "sysnet76"):
        $ ./ajfs mnt `hostname` `hostname` 8900
    On subsequent nodes:
        $ ./ajfs mnt `hostname` `hostname` 8900 sysnet76 8900
    (this assumes that there exists a directory in the current directory named
    the same as the current hostname for every node in the cluster)

You might need to specify the path to Thrift if you're system can't find the
shared library on its own. Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the path that contains the
shared library for thrift, and then start AJFS as before.
