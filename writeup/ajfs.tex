% TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%  USENIX '05
% originally a template for producing IEEE-format articles using LaTeX.
%   written by Matthew Ward, CS Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
% adapted by David Beazley for his excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings,
%   Tcl 96
% turned into a smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to
%   both the above pioneers
% use at your own risk.  Complaints to /dev/null.
% make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point

% Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to separate
% the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that people can
% more easily include the .sty file into an existing document.  Also
% changed to more closely follow the style guidelines as represented
% by the Word sample file. 

% Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you want
% foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the 
% usepackage command, below.

\subsection*{Abstract}
    Modern computer users use a variety of devices from a variety of locations,
and want their files to be accessible wherever they are. "Cloud storage"
services like Dropbox, Google Drive, SkyDrive, Apple iCloud and others offer
synchronized storage by storing your data on their servers.

    In this paper, we present AJFS: a fully-replicated networked file system
supporting multiple users, simultaneous editing of distinct files and robustness
against nodes failing or joining the system. Designed to similar use cases as
Dropbox, the system has been designed for simplicity, supporting safe
partially-causal consistency. We believe that AJFS offers a service that can
often be used in place of services like Dropbox, allowing users to keep their
own data synchronized without needing to use a third party.
