We implement AJFS with C++, based on FUSE 2.9.2 "fusexmp\_fh" example and thrift. It consists of about 2800 lines of code, and can be divided into three major function components:

\emph{Host}: Host is the instance of thrift host, which provides remote access services to each other. The services consists of two categories, file operations and lock services. File operations include all the fuse file operations, except for the "read" type operations mentioned in Section \ref{sec:designOverview}. Lock operations include \texttt{lock()}, \texttt{join()}, \texttt{requestJoinLock()} and \texttt{getJoinLock()}. Section \ref{sec:designOverview} and \ref{sec:joinProcedure} have introduced the services.

\emph{Lock}: Lock consists of two categories: join lock and file lock. Join lock is for server joining and file lock is for file protection. When a server joins in a cluster, the join lock needs to be acquired before doing any file rsync work, this guarantees the file consistency after server joined in. File lock is used to maintain file consistency with multiple users. When a file is locked for writing, it cannot be written by another user. Unlike other cloud storage applications which provide a copy of the original file to allow simultaneously editing, we use lock to achieve safety and simple implementation.

\emph{File operations}: File operations in AJFS are inherited from FUSE, but we repack them to two components: local file operations and fuse operations. This is to simplify the seperation of file operation requests from local server and remote servers. A file operation request from local server will go into fuse operation handler, which will propagate the request to other servers as well as performing the local request. File operation requests from remote servers will go to thrift server handler, which will perform local file operations only.

When AJFS is executed, we launch three threads to handle the three components seperately. This helps to make the function components easy to understand and debug.
