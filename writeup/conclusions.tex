% TODO - this needs to be fleshed out.

We've presented AJFS, a fully replicated network file system designed for
similar use cases to cloud storage systems like Dropbox.

While performance is not a primary objective in systems like this, the system
has significant performance limitations that prevent largescale adoption.
Moreover, the lack of support for hosts without connectivity prohibits
replacement of services like Dropbox.

None the less, AJFS provides a safe, fully replicated file system that supports
view changes of several varieties.
