% TODO - this needs to be fleshed out.

We've presented AJFS, a fully replicated network file system designed for
loosely similar use cases to cloud storage systems like Dropbox.

While performance is not a primary objective in systems like this, the system
has significant performance limitations that prevent large-scale adoption.
Moreover, the lack of support for hosts without connectivity prohibits
true replacement of services like Dropbox.

In its current state, the system is a slightly better match for replicating NFS
across systems. None the less, AJFS successfully provides a safe, fully
replicated file system that supports view changes of several varieties.
